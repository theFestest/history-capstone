title : "A Closer Look at Runaway Advertisements"

  HIST099 Capstone project by Michael Bartholic.

  In 1838, Maryland Jesuits arranged for the sale of at least 272 enslaved individuals. Georgetown University greatly benefited from the transaction as proceeds were largely used to pay the school's debts. While the truth of this sale is increasingly common knowledge, we have a duty to recognize and remember those individuals owned by the Jesuits or others for the vibrance of their lives as real human beings. In this visualization, I present excerpts from the analysis of dozens of runaway advertisements from the Washington DC region. While not their intended purpose, these adverts offer glimpses of the lives and characteristics of their subjects.
