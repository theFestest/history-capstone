        <description>Two Hundred Dollars Reward. – Ran away from the subscriber on the night of the 8th October instant, my two servants John and Lewis; they are brothers. John is about twenty three years of age, near six feet high, stout and well made; is a first-rate house servant; by trade is a white-washer; he is a mulatto, perhaps may be called copper colored; his voice is strong and speaks pretty quick. Lewis is two years younger, about five feet six or eight inches high, brighter in color than John; stammers very much at times; is also stout. They have each a good suit of clothes, but color not recollected. It is very probable that they have forged free papers; they are both quite intelligent, having been much employed as waiters in genteel families. I will give the above reward for both, if taken and secured so that I get them again; or one hundred for either if taken in a non-slaveholding State; or half the amount if taken in Maryland. [oct 18] [John Harry, Georgetown, D.C.]</description>

        <description><![CDATA[ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.—On the 5th instant, my servant JACOB, a slave for life, left home with the avowed intention of going to Londoun county, Virginia, to harvest. I gave him a pass for that purpose. I now have reason to believe that he has made off, perhaps to Pennsylvania. He is very tall, from three to four inches above six feet high; not heavy built, but good size, and very active in his movements; black, very pleasant countenance when spoken to, regular features, and good teeth. I do not recollect any particular marks about him. Is about 22 or 23 years of age, very intelligent, and a good deal of cunning. It is useless to describe his clothing, as he has no doubt procured new clothes, having without a doubt a good supply of money. He may have forged free papers, or procured the free papers of some of his acquaintances. <br>I will give $50 for his apprehension in the State of Maryland, or $100 if taken in Pennsylvania, so that I may get him again.<br>John Harry,<br>Georgetown, D.C.<br>July 30—solm<br>P.S.
